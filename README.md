# Gothic Craft official project.
## What we do?
We are the [Gothic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_(video_game)) fans group, which trying to bridge that game to **Minecraft**. 

Our goal is to gather Gothic players in one place. Gothic multiplayer servers have a lot of drawbacks, they are difficult to expand and maintain.
However, we have **Minecraft**! This is not just a really awesome game, but also great base for creating custom scenarios e.g RPG games bridges
 like Gothic Craft. Compared to Gothic, Minecraft is more friendly platform for enhance. 
 
 We want to build system ready to deploy by everyone, open for modifications and other point of view. So that's why we create it **open source**.
 Gothic fans deserve for great multiplayer platform, so here we are.
 
 We are totally **non-profit** organization, so if you want to help us maintain our **production** infrastructure, please see :heart: [**Sponsorship**]() section.
